"Network connectivity in major depression: extending previous findings from a large public dataset by meta-analysis across sites"

Summary:

Abnormal resting-state fMRI functional connectivity within canonical brain networks has been reported in major depressive disorder (MDD) across several studies. A previous meta-analysis (including 556 MDD and 518 controls) reported hypoconnectivity within the frontoparietal network and hyper-connectivity within the default mode network (DMN) 1. Recently, the Meta-MDD consortium released a very large multi-site dataset of resting state fMRI data 1,300 MDD and 1,128 controls collected by 25 groups. A previous analysis of this dataset focused on the DMN and found that its connectivity was decreased in MDD 2. We leveraged the Meta-MDD dataset to perform a meta-analysis across sites of effect of MDD and symptoms on network connectivity. Our goal was to extend previous findings to all canonical brain networks, evaluate heterogeneity across sites, and estimate effect sizes and prediction intervals to inform future studies.
